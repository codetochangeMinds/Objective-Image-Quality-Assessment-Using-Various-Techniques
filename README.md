# Objective-Image-Quality-Assessment-Using-Various-Techniques
Implemented the IEEE transaction on Objective Image Quality Assessment using SVR, in this project we first created the feature matrix from the LIVE DATASET and further trained model using svm, nerural network and linear regression. We used the PLCC score to measure the accuracy of model. The feature matrix was generated using the interpolation techinque, all the images in the dataset was of the different size. Further splitted the data into train data and test data and used the test data to predict the subjective score. Subjective score(given) and the predicted score were used to train the model.

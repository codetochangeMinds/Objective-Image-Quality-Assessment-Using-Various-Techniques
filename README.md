# Objective-Image-Quality-Assessment-Using-Various-Techniques
Implemented the IEEE transaction on Objective Image Quality Assessment using SVR, in this project we first created the feature matrix from the LIVE DATASET and further trained model using svm, nerural network and linear regression. The feature matrix was generated using the interpolation techinque and SVD. Further splitted the data into train data and test data and used the test data to predict to find the predicted score, the PLCC score was calculated using the predicted score and the subjective score(given). We used the PLCC score as a metric to measure the accuracy of model. All the images in the dataset were of different size.
